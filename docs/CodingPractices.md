# Coding Standards and Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for developing our web-based video game using C++. Following these guidelines will help ensure code quality, readability, maintainability, and efficient concurrency management.

## General Guidelines

- **Consistent Formatting**: Use consistent indentation (4 spaces) and brace styles (`Allman` style for functions, `K&R` style for everything else).
- **Naming Conventions**: Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, and `PascalCase` for struct and class names.
- **Comments**: Write meaningful comments to explain the purpose of the code, especially complex logic and multi-threaded sections.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to capture and report errors.

## Headers and Libraries

- Include necessary headers and libraries at the beginning of the file.
- Group related includes together and order them logically (e.g., standard libraries, third-party libraries, project headers).

```cpp
#include <winsock2.h>
#include <windows.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <sstream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <fstream>
#include <openssl/sha.h>

#include "misc_lib.h"

#pragma comment(lib, "ws2_32.lib")
